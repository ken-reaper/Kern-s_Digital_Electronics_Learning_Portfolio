# Kern-s_Digital_Electronics_Learning_Portfolio
This is the Digital Electronics equivalent of learning portfolio. Throughout this, I will be : --> explaining the theory -->implementing code in VHDL through Vivado software -->writing testbenches and displaying simulation -->and sometimes implementing designs on hardware (FPGA)
